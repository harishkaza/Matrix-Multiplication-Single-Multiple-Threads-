PROJECT 1

In this project we have written four programs (Prog0, Prog1, Prog2, Prog3). Two are used to perform the matrix multiplication on 2 matrices. 

Prog0 generates 2 random matrices and writes them into two different files.
Prog1 does the multiplication using single thread and writes the generated matrix to a file.
Prog2 does the multiplication using multiple threads and writes the generated matrix to a file.
Prog3 compares the two matrices generated from Prog1 and Prog2.

GETTING STARTED

In this folder there are 6 files apart from the readme -> Prog0.c, Prog1.c, Prog2.c, Prog3.c, script.sh, sample_output.txt

Prog0.c generates random numbers and stores them into 2 files( one for each matrix ).
Prog0.c takes 3 arguments. They are size of the matrix, path to file A.txt ( into which the contents of A are stored) and 
path to file B.txt ( into which the contents of B are stored ).

Prog1.c reads the contents from file A and file B and stores the values in the form of matrices A and B respectively
and finds out their product and stores it in file C1.txt.
Prog1.c takes 4 inputs, which are -> path to input file for A, path to input file for B, path to output file for C1 and size of the matrix

Prog2.c takes number of threads as input argument, does the same as Prog1 but using multi threading and writes the output into C2.txt.
Prog2.c takes 5 inputs, which are -> path to input file for A, path to input file for B, path to output file for C2, number of threads to use and size of the matrix.
The size of matrix should be divisible by number of threads.

Prog3.c reads files C1.txt and C2.txt and compares the two generated matrices.
Prog3.c takes 3 inputs, which are -> size of matrix, path to file for C1 and path to file for C2

The script.sh file contains all the required commands to run. It compiles all the four programs and stores the values of matrix C from Prog1.c and Prog2.c in output/C1.txt and output/C2.txt and checks if they are same.
This script also creates two directories namely bin and output.
The directory bin contains the compiled programs
The directory output will contain the files generated by our programs. Which are -> Files for A and B generated by Prog0, File for C1 generated by Prog1 and File for C2 generated by Prog2
Currently, script.sh passes 500 as the matrix size accross programs and 10 as the number of threads to Prog2. This can be modified as per requirement.

The script outputs the time prog1 started and ended and the time prog2 ended and if the two matrices generated by prog1 and prog2 are same or not.

sample_output.txt contains the output of the project when run for matrix size 500 and number of threads 10.
RUNNING THE PROGRAM

All we have to do is run "bash script.sh".
